<p>I&#8217;m at Harvard all this week, which is overwhelming in its own right. I&#8217;m here to research B. F. Skinner&#8217;s papers, housed at the university archives &#8211; even more overwhelming knowing that I have 30 hours and that there are some 27+ cubic feet of materials to go through.</p>

<p>I am just going to jot down a bunch of thoughts from today. I haven&#8217;t yet really gone through all the photos I&#8217;ve taken &#8211; and I should be clear of my process, I guess. I take photos of interesting papers when a name or a topic catches my eye. But I also take notes about impressions I get, even about the things that I don&#8217;t necessarily document with a snap.</p>

<p>One of the things at the forefront of my mind as I move through B. F. Skinner&#8217;s materials is &#8220;what was he like?&#8221; I feel like I was so caught up in documenting the saga about Sidney Pressey&#8217;s attempts to commercialize his teaching machine, that I missed those cues when I was <a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/03/12/osu1">going through his materials at OSU</a>. (I&#8217;ll need to go back.)</p>

<p>Skinner&#8217;s personality shines through, and I think, in part, it&#8217;s because what&#8217;s in his archives: <em>everything</em>. I think about this a lot with my own curation processes &#8211; deleting old tweets and emails, not really caring to leave much of a digital record behind. As I went through Pressey&#8217;s papers, I wondered too: what&#8217;s been curated here? What letters did he keep and what did he ditch? I&#8217;ve approached Skinner&#8217;s the same way, knowing of course that a person&#8217;s gift of their papers to a university is already a certain cultivation of their image &#8211; a purposeful effort to craft how future scholars will remember them. </p>

<p>B. F. Skinner&#8217;s papers craft an interesting picture indeed. </p>

<p>He wrote a lot of letters to the editor, correcting the scientific record, if you will. He wrote a lot of letters to businesses, complaining about salespeople and ethics. He filed a lot of complaints with &#8220;higher-ups.&#8221; </p>

<p>He received a lot of letters too. I guess you&#8217;d expect that if you wrote about &#8220;a baby in a box&#8221; in a popular women&#8217;s magazine. Some people were fans. Some people were not. If you&#8217;re the guy associated with animal training, it&#8217;s no surprise, I guess, that you&#8217;d get letters about how to train pets, or how to craft science fair projects about training pets. If you&#8217;re the guy associated with pigeons and the war effort, it&#8217;s no surprise that you&#8217;d get a lot of letters about how to train birds, how to capture birds, how to breed birds, how to kill birds, and so on.</p>

<p>So far, I&#8217;ve seen one letter from Patrick Suppes (another character in <em>Teaching Machines</em>). I&#8217;ve seen nothing from Sidney Pressey &#8211; perhaps it&#8217;s in the box of correspondence more clearly labeled &#8220;teaching machines.&#8221; There&#8217;s a letter that Norman Crowder&#8217;s company wrote to Skinner in which Skinner said he didn&#8217;t want to work with them. (The correspondence between Pressey and Crowder was quite friendly, by contrast. And I don&#8217;t think Suppes reached out to Pressey ever. I do not really know yet if any of these connections or non-connections matter.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m seeing some hints in some of the letters about how quickly the (commercial) promises of teaching machines faltered. But right now, based on what the Skinner papers contain, I only see tons and tons of interest in teaching machines. And in pigeons. Everyone loved the pigeons.</p>
