<p>I can tell that it&#8217;s almost time for me to turn from research to writing. I&#8217;m dreaming about the book. I dream about its organization. I dream about the acknowledgements. I dream about what primary documents are left to track down and to read. I dream about how I&#8217;m going to tackle the writing process. I dream about the introduction. I dream about the blurbs.</p>

<p>They aren&#8217;t panicky dreams. Not yet. I know those will come soon enough. </p>

<p>Last night, I dream about the outline &#8211; how the book will start. How the first few chapters will go. But I woke up before I could wind my way through it all. And that&#8217;s what I thought about this morning too went I went for <a href="http://audreywatters.com/2018/11/14/fitbit">my AM walk</a>: where and how does the book end? (Right now, I think it ends, as it (almost) begins, with the IBM punchcard.)</p>
