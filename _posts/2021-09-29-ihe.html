<p><em>"This is a landmark book."</p></em>

<p>I am, of course, thrilled with the book review published in John Warner's "Just Visiting" column on <em>Inside Higher Ed</em>. I won't lie: he's one of the people who had an advance copy of the book that I was most eager to hear from. What he's written has really exceeded what I could have ever hoped for. "A landmark book." Phew.</p>

<em><p>At least I hope that's going to be the case, because Watters's history of personalized learning reflects Faulkner's aphorism from "Requiem for a Nun" -- "The past isn't dead. It isn't even past." Better understanding this presence may make for clearer decision making for how we integrate technology into teaching and learning.</p></em>

<p><em>Reading Teaching Machines is like donning a pair of glasses that suddenly makes much of the present more explicable. This is why I want to urge people to read this book with all possible haste."</em></p>
