<p><em>Forbes</em> contributor Peter Greene has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petergreene/2021/08/25/an-invaluable-history-of-the-teaching-machine/?sh=524f6a847934">reviewed</a> <em>Teaching Machines</em>. I'm particularly fond of the kicker:</p>

<p><em>The book is fascinating and very readable, loaded with well-chosen details. Reading this story, one suspects it might be fair to say that it is ed tech, not public education, that has not made a significant step forward in the last 100 years.</em></p>
