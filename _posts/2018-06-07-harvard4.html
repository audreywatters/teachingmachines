<p>I&#8217;m out of the archives early today. B. F. Skinner&#8217;s papers are housed offsite, so I have to put in a request a day in advance to have materials brought to the reading room. I plowed through everything I&#8217;d requested for today in record time.</p>

<p>There wasn&#8217;t much of interest in today&#8217;s boxes to do with teaching machines. (I did get an idea for another book though. Dammit, it still involves Skinner&#8217;s work.) </p>

<p>One noteworthy item in today&#8217;s materials: an audio recording made by a former student &#8220;concerning personality characteristics of B. F. Skinner.&#8221; There wasn&#8217;t a date on this, but clearly it was made when Skinner was still alive. There was a lot of praise for Skinner in it &#8211; his &#8220;warm camaraderie,&#8221; the open invitation he had with members of the department to come by on Sundays and swim in his pool. That sort of stuff. He was described as a &#8220;strategist&#8221; &#8211; is that a personality trait? I don&#8217;t know. In the final moments of the recording &#8211; and it&#8217;s quite short &#8211; the person describes Skinner&#8217;s current status as &#8220;cloudy&#8221; and starts to condemn the trajectory that his work has taken. Something about becoming too entrenched, too philosophical. And the recording ends abruptly.</p>

<p>Skinner remains, in so many ways, a mystery to me. I am having a hard time reconciling his work, his politics, and &#8211; whatever this thing is &#8211; his personality.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got a few more boxes to go through tomorrow before my time at Harvard (this week, at least) is up. I&#8217;ll be looking at some newspaper clippings and a few more boxes of correspondence. One of the things that&#8217;s striking: how little correspondence I can find between Skinner and certain figures. (Crowder, namely.) Perhaps the letters are in a later box. I guess I will have to come back&#8230;</p>

<p>(If you&#8217;re interested in what I&#8217;ve I&#8217;ve discovered during my week here, here are updates from Days <a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/06/04/harvard1">1</a>, <a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/06/05/harvard2">2</a>, and <a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/06/06/harvard3">3</a>.) </p>
