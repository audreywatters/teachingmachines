<p>(I&#8217;m at Harvard this week, going through B. F. Skinner&#8217;s archives. You can read about <a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/06/04/harvard1">Day 1 here</a>.)</p>

<p>So I greatly miscalculated how many boxes of materials I can get through this week. I made progress today, but I am definitely going to have to come back to Cambridge again. </p>

<p>And that&#8217;s okay. I already know I&#8217;ll have to return to the Pressey archives at OSU, too. It&#8217;s hard to know, I think, going into an intensive research project like this &#8211; decades of someone&#8217;s personal, professional papers &#8211; what exactly you&#8217;re going to find that will become &#8220;the story&#8221; about them. And then when you figure out what &#8220;the story&#8221; is going to be, you surely discover that you&#8217;ve missed some of the details in your first pass through all their personal letters and such.</p>

<p>I mean, I think I know what I want my chapter on Skinner to say. Perhaps it&#8217;s obvious &#8211; something about teaching machines, right? But reading through all these folders worth of letters, I see new angles, I find new leads, and I&#8217;m not sure. His work on the air crib, for example. His book <em>Walden Two</em> and how that shaped his politics (and his scholarly practice) &#8211; and how these shape &#8220;programmed instruction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of what I have found going through his papers is clearly outside the purview of this book. No doubt. Or&#8230; actually&#8230; some doubt. Or maybe it&#8217;s another book. Or maybe it&#8217;s a separate article. </p>

<p>I found today a bunch of correspondence, for example, between a very young Temple Grandin (she must&#8217;ve been about 19) and Skinner. In them, she talks about her usage of programmed instruction materials. She speaks of her work at a children&#8217;s hospital with patients who are (her words) &#8220;the &#8216;quote&#8217; problem child.&#8221; </p>

<p>I found a bunch of correspondence between Skinner and Sargent and Eunice Shriver about the use of operant conditioning as part of the War on Poverty. (Eunice seemed particularly keen on Skinner&#8217;s &#8220;air crib&#8221; too.)</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t even got to the boxes on teaching machines yet &#8211; I&#8217;ve re-arranged the order I&#8217;m going through materials so I&#8217;ll get to those tomorrow. In some ways, I can follow up in my chapter on Skinner on the story I will tell about Sidney Pressey &#8211; that of a psychologist who failed to commercialize his teaching machine. But Skinner was so far from obscure. And his ideas about behavioral conditioning are so much more pervasive than I think we want to recognize&#8230;</p>

<p>(I need to figure out how to reconcile some of Skinner's politics too. Among the papers I read today was a letter in support of a former student's application to be a conscientious objector. There was another letter from a former student who'd been arrested as a member of SDS. How does Skinner's activism here &#8211; or his support of his students' activism -- fit with his writings about <em>Freedom and Dignity</em>, for example, and his rejection of the idea of free will and human agency?)</p>
