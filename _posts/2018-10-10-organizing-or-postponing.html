<p>Yes, I am doing research, and yes, I am postponing the writing. But I disagree strongly here about the word &#8220;just.&#8221; The research right now is everything, and I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve done enough of it yet to write the book I want to write. If I&#8217;m not writing come January, it&#8217;s because I am procrastinating. But not now.</p>

<p>Some days, it does feel like I&#8217;m spinning my wheels. Some days, I get stuck trying to follow a lead or track down a source. (I still can&#8217;t find the materials I&#8217;d like on Norman Crowder so that I can flesh him out as a character, for example.) Some days, I am overwhelmed by the amount of PDFs I have downloaded and still have not read. Some days I balk at research and reading I <em>have</em> done, and the task of shaping it all into a story.</p>

<p>I am using a couple of pieces of software to help me organize my research: Scrivener, Zotero, and Aeon Timeline. Some days, I find myself frustrated with how well I have organized and tagged the data there. Some days, making progress on the book involves re-shuffling these systems. I joked with Kin this week that I might buy a big cork board so I can transfer some of this digital planning into an analog visualization. Maybe I am just postponing the writing....</p>
