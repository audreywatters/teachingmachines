<p>Joshua Kim has reviewed <em>Teaching Machines</em> in <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/learning-innovation/case-‘teaching-machines’">his column on Inside Higher Ed</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In Teaching Machines, Watters has provided a sturdy historical foundation for her long-running (and highly influential) skepticism of the efficacy of most educational technologies. Teaching Machines is a book, and Watters is a scholar, that both deserve a central place in our academic conversations about the future of teaching and learning.</p></blockquote>
