<p>I was a guest on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChLC45yh9DTkerV-TSJJo3A">API Storytelling</a> on Friday. This is one of Kin's shows, and as the name of it suggests, it's not at all about ed-tech typically. But it is (ostensibly) about storytelling -- about the narratives of the tech sector and how that shapes what gets built/bought/sold -- so discussion of the book was perfect.</p>
