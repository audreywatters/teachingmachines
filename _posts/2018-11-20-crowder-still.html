<p><a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/03/27/crowder">Earlier this spring</a>, I posted a request, asking for The Internet to help me track down Norman A. Crowder, someone I&#8217;d hoped to make one of the key characters in <em>Teaching Machines</em>. Six+ months later, I&#8217;m really no closer to finding out more details about him. Yes, I&#8217;ve made some contacts with surviving family members. I&#8217;ve received a few emails from people who say they talked to him before he passed away about his work on teaching machines. But I haven&#8217;t found any great trove of letters or documents &#8211; nothing that would help me flesh him out into a dynamic character for the book.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s such a pity because he is posited throughout the programmed instruction literature of the 1960s as someone whose theories ran counter to those of much the (now) better-known B. F. Skinner &#8211; the latter insisted on &#8220;linear programming&#8221; while Crowder developed the &#8220;branching&#8221; method. (Surely there is something to be said here about the difference between the administrative and archival work that happens around the writings of a Harvard professor and that which does not occur for someone who worked for industry.)</p>

<p>I have gleaned quite a bit about Crowder from newspaper, magazine, and journal articles, don&#8217;t get me wrong. I know when he was born and when he died. I can piece together some of where he worked &#8211; the organization I&#8217;m most interested in is Western Design, a division of U. S. Industries. That was where he devised the AutoTutor, from what I can tell. A chapter in a book I am currently reading &#8211; <em>Programmed Teaching: A Symposium on Automation in Teaching</em> (1965) &#8211; says that he came up with the idea for his &#8220;scrambled textbook&#8221; in 1955 while working to train electrical engineers. That sounds like a good story, but I&#8217;m not in much of a position to tell it since I just can&#8217;t uncover all the details.</p>

<p>And that sucks.</p>
