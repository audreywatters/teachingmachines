<p>This isn&#8217;t a &#8220;lazy web&#8221; question as much as it is an &#8220;I don&#8217;t currently have access to a research library&#8221; question. I&#8217;m looking for a handful of articles &#8211; articles whose full-text is not available online, from what I can tell &#8211; and I&#8217;m hoping that if I post the list here that copies might techno-magically show up in my email inbox:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Kandel, I. (1932) &#8220;The New School.&#8221; Teachers College Record. Vol. 33. p 506. </p></li>
<li><p>Snedden, D. (1930) &#8220;Ameliorating Mass-Production Processes in Education.&#8221; Teachers College Record. Vol. 32. p 338&#8211;47.</p></li>
<li><p>Wood, B. (1936) &#8220;Criteria of Individualized Education.&#8221; Teachers College Record. Vol 38. p 227.</p></li>
<li><p>Wood, B. (1931) &#8220;Mechanical Education Wanted.&#8221; Harvard Teachers Record. Vol 1. p 46&#8211;50.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(I&#8217;m actually toying with the idea of hiring a research assistant &#8211; perhaps a student at a university with a great library &#8211; to pull some more (similar) kinds of articles for me. If you are interested in some paid work of this sort, <a href="mailto:mail@audreywatters.com">let me know</a>.)</p>
