<p>I&#8217;ve created a timeline for &#8220;<a href="http://teachingmachin.es/timeline.html">The History of Teaching Machines</a>&#8221; as part of my research for my book <em>Teaching Machines</em>. (I made this timeline in order to procrastinate revisiting my draft.)</p>

<p><a href="http://teachingmachin.es/timeline.html"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/2017-06-25-screenshot.png"></a></p>

<p>Like &#8220;<a href="http://network.hackeducation.com/pearson.html">The History of Pearson</a>&#8221; timeline I recently created, I&#8217;ve used <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/">timeline.js</a> to build this site.</p>

<p>This timeline does not purport to offer a history of education technology. It&#8217;s a history of <em>teaching machines</em>, drawing mostly on the research I&#8217;ve published on Hack Education.</p>

<p>Consider this a work-in-progress. I&#8217;ll continue to fill in the gaps with missing details. (As this project is <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/ed-tech-social-graph">powered by a GitHub repository</a>, you can always leave a message there or file an &#8220;issue&#8221; if you see something I&#8217;ve overlooked.)</p>
