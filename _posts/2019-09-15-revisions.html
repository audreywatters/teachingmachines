<p>I&#8217;ve been pretty aware of how angry that voice is in the last few <a href="http://hewn.substack.com">HEWNs</a> I&#8217;ve sent out. And I know that that&#8217;s my reputation: I&#8217;m ed-tech&#8217;s Cassandra. A very very pissed off one at that.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t want <em>Teaching Machines</em> to be an angry book as much as I wanted it to be an interesting and honest one. Early in the writing process, I talked to several people who said they would be more interested in reading a narrative than in reading criticism or analysis. </p>

<p>So that&#8217;s sort of what I wrote: the story of teaching machines from the late 1920s thru the late 1960s; the story of bureaucratic and technological educational reforms in post-war America; the story of Sidney Pressey and B. F. Skinner; and the story of how corporations really screwed those two psychologists over as the &#8220;business of education&#8221; expanded its hold on public schools.</p>

<p>But now, re-reading my draft, I do recognize that I need to interject my analysis, my voice a lot more. I mean, I have opinions on all that I&#8217;ve written &#8211; opinions on behaviorism, business, politics, and so on. I can try to play the part of a dispassionate journalist, I suppose. But I&#8217;m not one. Most of the people familiar with my work know that.</p>

<p>So the trick with these revisions is to integrate the narrative and the analysis. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve entirely figured that out yet.</p>
