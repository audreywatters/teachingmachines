<p>I was a guest again on Bryan Alexander's Future Trends Forum. I was there to talk about the book, but as no one but Bryan had read it, our conversation covered a lot of other issues (that I hope I deftly tried to tie into book promotion). As always, the audience had brilliantly tough questions.</p>
