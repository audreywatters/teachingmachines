<p>An excerpt of <em>Teaching Machines</em> is in <em>The MIT Press Reader</em>: "<a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-engineered-student-on-b-f-skinners-teaching-machine/">The Engineered Student: On B. F. Skinner’s Teaching Machine</a>." </p>

<p>"The story of teaching machines is deeply intertwined with Skinner’s psycho-technologies, which laid a foundation from which education technology has never entirely broken."</p>
