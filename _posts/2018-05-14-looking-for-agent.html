<p>The School of Journalism is holding its commencement ceremony this week, and even though I&#8217;m not graduating I&#8217;m going &#8211; I guess it&#8217;s worth taking part in some sort of end-of-Spencer ritual. I&#8217;ll have more to say elsewhere about &#8220;what happened&#8221; and &#8220;what&#8217;s next,&#8221; but I thought I&#8217;d quickly note here on this site that <em>Teaching Machines</em> did take a major leap forward in the last five months.</p>

<p>I now have a book proposal and a sample chapter &#8211; I sent these to an agent this morning. I am looking for representation for this book obviously but I am hoping to be able to transition from &#8220;blogger&#8221; to &#8220;book author&#8221; more completely. </p>

<p>If you know of a good agent (or if you are an agent) and you&#8217;re interested in what&#8217;s poised to be the best work of education technology history in the last few decades, let me know.</p>

<p>(I have also made plans to travel to Cambridge in a couple of weeks to visit B. F. Skinner's papers. Hopefully I will get to Patrick Suppes' archives at Stanford some time in June too.)</p>
