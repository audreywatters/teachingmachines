<p>Another year has (almost) passed and I&#8217;ve made no progress (once again) on <em>Teaching Machines</em>. But I have made progress in resolving a number of personal crises &#8211; or so I hope. And I&#8217;m getting better at finding ways to support myself financially. That is, I&#8217;ve finally realized that I can make ends meet through speaking fees. Of course, traveling and speaking isn&#8217;t really conducive to working on a book. But I&#8217;m hoping that things will settle down a bit soon &#8211; after I finish my &#8220;Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2016&#8221; series &#8211; and I can really focus on completing the book.</p>

<p>I have a better sense now of what I want to write. It&#8217;s not going to be a history, but a critical study. I want to incorporate critical theory into a field in which such ideas are almost entirely absent. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to write a book proposal in January, ship it off to an agent, and hopefully get some forward motion finally. Soon.</p>
