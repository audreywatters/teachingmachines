<p>I wrapped up my visit to The Ohio State University Archives today. (And I&#8217;m already planning my next trip to a university archives &#8211; that would be Harvard in May.)</p>

<p>Among the materials I went through today were the correspondences between Sidney Pressey and several manufacturing companies, as he tried to convince someone to help him bring his &#8220;Automatic Teacher&#8221; to market. He finally settled on W. M. Welch Manufacturing Company, which agreed to work with him. </p>

<p>Most companies responded to Pressey&#8217;s inquiries that they couldn&#8217;t imagine a market for machines. They might have been right &#8211; Pressey struggled not only to get the device built to his specifications. He struggled to sell them to schools.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not a particularly happy story. Pressey&#8217;s health suffered, and his marriage fell apart. After years struggling to get the machine to market, W. M. Welch discontinued the product in 1937 &#8211; some 11 years after Pressey first demoed the device at a American Psychological Association meeting. Less than 200 were ever sold.</p>

<p>Perhaps Pressey was just too early with his invention. A decade or so later, the teaching machine became popular again (briefly), thanks in part to their association with Harvard&#8217;s B. F. Skinner, thanks in part to Americans&#8217; post-War commitment to education gadgetry. </p>

<p>I took a lot of notes while at the archives. I took a lot of photos. (The iPhone makes a decent scanning device.) I will spend the evening going through things, turning those photos into PDFs, for example. And making sure everything has tags so I can find it all easily.</p>

<p>I plan to use Pressey&#8217;s story for my sample chapter I&#8217;m writing for Sam Freedman&#8217;s class. Thank goodness there are still a few more days of Spring Break&#8230;</p>
