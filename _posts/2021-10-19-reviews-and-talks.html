<p>Michael Horn reviewed <em>Teaching Machines</em> <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/quest-for-an-automatic-teacher-book-review-teaching-machines-watters/">in Education Next</a>. He tone-polices my work in the first sentence, and no surprise, he didn't like the book.</p>

<p>The NEA Today published <a href="https://www.nea.org/advocating-for-change/new-from-nea/far-reaching-legacy-first-teaching-machines?utm_content=183808426&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-20774514">an interview with me</a> about the book</p>

<p>I gave a book talk to the Integrated Design & Media graduate colloquium at NYU.</p>
