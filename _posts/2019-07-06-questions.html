<p>As I turn to editing, I do still have a few lingering research questions &#8211; questions that I figured I&#8217;d post here so I can have them top-of-mind while editing (and, of course, in case anyone out there can help me):</p>

<ul>
<li>What happened to the Center for Programed Instruction? When and why did it close?</li>
<li>Why did Norman Crowder start working on programmed instruction? And what role did his employer, U.S. Industries, play in making sure his &#8220;alternative&#8221; to Skinner&#8217;s instructional technology was given such prominence in the media?</li>
<li>What are the connections between cybernetics and teaching machines?</li>
<li>Is there a good corporate or military case study with the use of teaching machines &#8211; one well-documented in archival materials? Say, Hughes Aircraft? (And how does this connect to the rest of the story I'm telling?)</li>
<li>Are there letters (or other primary sources) that address the use of programmed instruction in Freedom Summer? (And if so, do I have time to take another research trip?)</li>
</ul>
