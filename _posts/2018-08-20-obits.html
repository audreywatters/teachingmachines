<p>The obituary is a strange genre. (I say this having written two.) An obituary typically contains the basic facts of the deceased&#8217;s life: where and when they were born; when and sometimes how they died; where they went to school; the names of wives and husbands and children and the names of any other &#8220;surviving family members.&#8221; An obituary, whether written by a family member or by someone at the newspaper, attempts to narrate a life &#8211; who was this person; what did they do; what were they like?</p>

<p>All this makes obituaries quite useful when researching people &#8211; &#8220;captains of industry&#8221; to be sure, but also lesser known players in any field or event. Obituaries help you double-check some basic facts. But they can also give you glimpse of how someone was understood as a historical figure by their contemporaries.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve been gathering the obituaries for all the characters in my book.</p>

<p>B. F. Skinner&#8217;s obituary <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/20/obituaries/b-f-skinner-the-champion-of-behaviorism-is-dead-at-86.html">appeared on the front page of The New York Times</a> on this date in 1990. A1 news. &#8220;B. F. Skinner, the Champion Of Behaviorism, Is Dead at 86.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a different story than the one that Skinner told about himself in his three part (!) autobiography. I just finished reading book one, <em>Particulars of My Life</em>. There was far more talk of masturbation than I was prepared for, I will confess &#8211; not something The NYT chose to highlight in its 2200-word obit, thank god.</p>

<p>Sidney Pressey&#8217;s obituary &#8211; totalling less than 100 words &#8211; was picked up by the Associated Press and published in several Ohio newspapers. Norman Crowder&#8217;s appeared on page 10 of Section 2 of The Chicago Tribune and, notably I think, includes directions on how to get to the family farm for &#8220;a memorial celebration, buffet dinner and music.&#8221; Skinner had no funeral &#8211; &#8220;her father&#8217;s wish,&#8221; according to his daughter.</p>
