<p>It&#8217;s official. I signed the book contract late last night: the MIT University Press has agreed to publish <em>Teaching Machines</em>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m over-the-moon thrilled (particularly as I&#8217;ll have a great editor), although to be honest, I&#8217;m also feeling quite overwhelmed by the amount of work I have to do. </p>

<p>I have been talking about this book idea for a very long time now, and within the last six months it has finally become a lot more &#8220;real&#8221; &#8211; something that probably would not have happened without the Spencer Fellowship (and without Sam Freedman&#8217;s book writing class). I&#8217;m so grateful for that opportunity.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure how the book writing will affect the rest of my work on Hack Education (at the very least, I&#8217;m not sure what my annual year-end review of ed-tech will look like this December). But a book! <em>This</em> book! That&#8217;s so much more exciting!</p>
