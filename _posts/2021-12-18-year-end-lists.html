<p><em>Teaching Machines</em> is on several "best of" lists -- you know the kind that are frequently published at year's end. These include Librarian Shipwreck's <a href="https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2021/12/15/my-favorite-books-from-2021/">favorite books of the year</a>. (This means a ton as I have mad admiration for their work.) And John Warner has again <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/roundup-2021-higher-ed-books">plugged the book</a> in his IHE column. (I owe you a drink, John.) Unfortunately, <em>Teaching Machines</em> was not on <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Holiday-Books-2021">Bill Gates' list of books he loved</a>. But then again, who would have expected him to actually read and learn about the field in which he philanthropizes?!</p>
