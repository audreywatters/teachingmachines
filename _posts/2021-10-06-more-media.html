<p>I was a guest on <a href="https://youtu.be/FexojLq-1Nc">EdNews' Week in Education</a> as well as the Karen Hunter Show. Neither host had read the book, and the discussion -- no surprise -- was not about <em>Teaching Machines</em>.</p>

<p>Diane Ravitch, on the other hand, did read my book, and she calls it "<a href="https://dianeravitch.net/2021/10/04/audrey-watters-brilliant-new-book-on-the-origins-of-ed-tech/">brilliant</a>."</p>
