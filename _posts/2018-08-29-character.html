<p><em>Teaching Machines</em> is a work of narrative non-fiction, a historical account of the development of auto-instructional devices in the mid-twentieth century. A historical account written by a journalist. A historical account written by someone who is much more comfortable with criticism than narrative history. </p>

<p>One of the challenges of this work &#8211; and I think this goes for any type of writing like this &#8211; is fleshing out the important historical figures as <em>characters</em>. I can only draw on the materials I have &#8211; I can&#8217;t invent characteristics or attribute actions or attitudes to people that I can&#8217;t back up with documentation. And I need to be careful about what I infer based on that documentation.</p>

<p>When workshopping the chapter I&#8217;ve written on Sidney Pressey, much of the feedback I received asked me to round him out a bit more. I&#8217;d based that chapter almost entirely on letters I found in <a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/03/12/osu1">his archives at Ohio State University</a>, narrating Pressey&#8217;s attempt (and failure) in the 1930s to commercialize the teaching machine he&#8217;d invented. In the letters, Pressey becomes increasingly agitated. And he admits in several of them that he&#8217;s collapsed under the strain of trying to bring his device to market. But just how neurotic was Pressey? (Is &#8220;neurotic&#8221; even the right word?) I need to find some other materials &#8211; diaries perhaps, or maybe letters his wife (soon-to-be, at the time, ex-wife) penned about his state of mind. Pressey, as I&#8217;ve written him, is rather one-dimensional.</p>

<p>Crafting B. F. Skinner into a character is much easier. There&#8217;s much more material to work with, for starters &#8211; <a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/06/04/harvard1">the boxes and boxes and boxes of his papers at Harvard</a>. Skinner also wrote an autobiography &#8211; three of them actually, totaling almost 1000 pages. (It&#8217;s quite a different effort to narrate one&#8217;s own legacy than the short autobiographical entry that Pressey wrote about himself for <em>A History of Psychology in Autobiography</em>, Volume V.) </p>

<p>Norman Crowder remains a challenge here, although I also remain determined to include him as a main character in the book. I don&#8217;t know the location of letters or diaries. (That&#8217;s not to say there aren&#8217;t primary materials. There are plenty of mentions in newspapers and magazines.) </p>

<p>There are a couple of other people that I think will be worth developing into characters: Reynold Johnson, for example, a school teacher hired by IBM to develop one of its earliest testing machines; Leslie Briggs, a student of Pressey&#8217;s who went on to do a lot of teaching machine work with the Air Force; and Lloyd Homme, who worked with Skinner and founded Teaching Machines, Inc. I know where some materials are about Johnson &#8211; some are at the Computer History Museum and some, I think, are at the ETS archives in Princeton. I&#8217;m not sure about the other two &#8211; perhaps locating some of the military stuff for Briggs would lead to more on Crowder, I don&#8217;t know. </p>

<p>I have to balance the narrative and the characters here. That is, I think I know where this story should go &#8211; from Pressey to Johnson to Skinner to Homme to Crowder to Briggs (and back to Pressey again). But I have to make sure there&#8217;s enough so that the story is rich and exciting and not just a list of interesting machines and an anecdote or two about the men who invented them.</p>
