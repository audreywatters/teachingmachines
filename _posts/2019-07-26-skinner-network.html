<p>I&#8217;ve often quipped that, to borrow from historian Ellen Condliffe Lagemann&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;Dewey lost; Thorndike won,&#8221; when it comes to ed-tech &#8220;Papert lost, and Skinner won.&#8221; But <em>Teaching Machines</em> isn&#8217;t really a book of quips, and in order to make the argument that Skinner has continued to have an enormous influence on education technology, I thought I might try to make a list of his students and colleagues &#8211; a bit like the <a href="http://network.hackeducation.com">networks I&#8217;ve tried to map out for ed-tech investment and such</a> &#8211; and see if there&#8217;s anything interesting to be gleaned.</p>
