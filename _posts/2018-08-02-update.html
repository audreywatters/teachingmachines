<p>This is Susan Burdorf, age 5. Her smiling face appears in numerous articles about teaching machines in the early 1960s. </p>

<p>Often, her name isn&#8217;t given in the captions. The kind of machine she&#8217;s using isn&#8217;t often described either. As such, she&#8217;s just a very enthusiastic little girl, pressing on the window of the letter she associates with the picture above it. As she&#8217;s right &#8211; T for tree &#8211; the machine will then display the next item to be matched.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s another frequently-used photograph: one of Eric Newhall, age 8. His name is often not given either; nor is the type of machine he&#8217;s using. Eric works alone, much more seriously and earnestly than the gleeful Susan &#8211; but surely just as posed. (I am particularly fond of what is written on the blackboard behind him: &#8220;teacher.&#8221;</p>

<p>A student at the Agassiz School in Cambridge, MA according to one caption, Eric seems to have sat for a number of photos. Eric at his desk. Eric on the floor. In all these, he&#8217;s using one of the earliest machines designed by B. F. Skinner, still a wooden box. The earliest newspaper article I&#8217;ve found using Eric&#8217;s image is 1954 &#8211; several years before Skinner struck a deal with Rheem Manufacturing to develop and sell a plastic version of his teaching machine.</p>

<p>Susan Burdorf is pictured with one of Rheem&#8217;s machines. (I <em>think</em>.) And I&#8217;m guessing that Susan is related to one Donald Burdorf, an engineer worked for Rheem. Skinner and Burdorf communicated regularly &#8211; although there&#8217;s no mention in any of their letters of Susan.</p>

<p>For as often as the histories of teaching machines have been written, I find there is still so much untold about these devices &#8211; about their design, their marketing, their usage; about the people involved who were <em>not</em> named Skinner or Pressey. I want to make sure that my book doesn&#8217;t fall into this trap: a story of what &#8220;great men&#8221; have built that ignores all the other factors that contributed to (and undermined, even) their inventions.</p>

<p>This is a challenge as I am, indeed, writing about these very men. But I want to underscore that the development of teaching machines was much more complicated than the oft-told story that gives narrative agency only to a handful of psychology professors or to the technology they imagined. That means thinking, if nothing else, about how commercialization worked (and didn&#8217;t work) &#8211; how and why, for example, certain photographs were taken with certain children and used to promote a certain image of this new educational experience: the experience of being taught by a machine.</p>
