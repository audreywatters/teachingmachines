<p><img src="/assets/images/cover.jpg" align="left" style="padding: 25px"><em>Teaching Machines</em> is available for pre-order <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/teaching-machines">via the MIT Press website</a> (and anywhere books are sold — consider <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780262045698">supporting your local bookseller</a>).</p>

<p>I spent a few days trying to revamp this website — before deciding that the template I had was just fine. Now I'm in the process of updating all my various social media accounts with a new profile pic based off the cover.</p>

<p>I absolutely love the cover, by the way. I wanted this photo to be used, but I wasn't sure permissions could be arranged. (That is, I wasn't sure the copyright holder could even be found.) I'll be writing more in the coming days and weeks — all before the publication date of August 3 — about various stories in and not in the book. Why this particular photo matters to me is definitely one of those stories.</p>

<p>I am not on social media these days, which is going to make book promotion interesting. But hopefully I can get back in the routine of blogging more often — here, <a href="https://hackeducation.com">there</a>, and <a href="https://audreywatters.com">elsewhere</a>. And at least those who pay attention to the particular bat signal of RSS will know I'm still around.</p>
