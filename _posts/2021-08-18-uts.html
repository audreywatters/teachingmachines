<p>I gave my first book talk at the University of Technology Sydney last week. You can watch the recording <a href="https://youtu.be/7uR654_GNeE">here</a>. There were a bunch of interesting questions, including one on connectivism as an alternative to behaviorism that I promised to think (and write) some more about.</p>
