<p>I arrived at Landgraf Hall a little earlier today, but archival research is hard work, and I&#8217;ve left a little earlier too. My back is killing me.</p>

<p>But I made huge progress today through the materials that I was hoping to find &#8211; letters to and from Reynold Johnson documenting his attempts to sell IBM his &#8220;Markograph,&#8221; the automated test scoring machine he&#8217;d invented as a high school teacher in Minnesota.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m interested in this development in part because it helps show where corporate interests were in educational machinery &#8211; in testing and in typewriters (something <a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/11/07/ets1">I wrote about yesterday</a> with regards to Ben D. Wood, whose papers I&#8217;m exploring.) I keep writing &#8220;poor Sidney Pressey&#8221; in my notebook because he seemed so unaware that there were all these other machinations underway &#8211; ones that he had no access to in Columbus, Ohio perhaps.</p>

<p>Most of the papers materials I went through today involved IBM. Wood had an incredibly close relationship with Thomas B. Watson, IBM&#8217;s founder who funded the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia (among other projects of Wood&#8217;s.) One can see in Wood the ways in which the history of educational testing and corporation&#8217;s role in education (and education technology) is deeply intertwined.</p>

<p>(IBM is pretty important to my narrative. IBM turned down Pressey. IBM had a bad business relationship with Skinner. IBM acquired Spencer's company, SRA. And so on.)</p>

<p>Also: there was a fair amount of red baiting in the correspondence between IBM and Wood, which &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure why, to be honest &#8211; I found a little shocking.</p>
