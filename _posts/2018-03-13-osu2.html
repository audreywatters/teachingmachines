<p>Tomorrow is my last day at The OSU Archives, and I know that I&#8217;ve saved the best for last &#8211; or rather, the way in which Sidney Pressey&#8217;s papers are arranged, I will finally get to all the correspondence surrounding his attempts in the 1930s to commercialize his teaching machines.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s the angle I want to go with for my chapter on him. But as I read around that episode, there&#8217;s so much more to consider.</p>

<p>I just want to jot down some of the thoughts from the day, as I read through Boxes 2, 3, and 4 of his papers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The bulk of communications between scholars in the mid- to late- 1900s involved sending one another reprints of journal articles. I&#8217;d like to think that library collections &#8211; and digital copies have ameliorated some of this. But I wonder how much of scholarly communication to this day is also &#8220;here is a PDF of what I wrote&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>What records are there now of scholars sharing their PDFs with one another &#8211; giving personal feedback (not just published feedback)?</p></li>
<li><p>Who does Pressey have &#8220;beef&#8221; with (and why)? I don&#8217;t just mean academic or philosophical differences &#8211; I mean <em>beef</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>What struck me reading through Pressey&#8217;s correspondence today &#8211; correspondence from the late 1960s and very much addressing &#8220;the state of higher education&#8221; &#8211; was how very little was said about student protests. And it made me think about how decontextualized so much of this research and scholarship was &#8211; not just in the 1960s, but throughout.</p></li>
<li><p>It is quite sad to see someone age through their papers and production, but Pressey was active until very very late in life. May we all be as fortunate.</p></li>
<li><p>Where are Norman Crowder&#8217;s papers? Why has no one written about his work?!</p></li>
</ul>
