<p>Today was my last day in the archives. I had two boxes of letters to go through and three boxes of newspaper clippings. (In the week I&#8217;ve spent here, I&#8217;ve barely scratched the surface of Skinner&#8217;s papers. There are, for example, still some 23 more boxes of correspondence to go through.)</p>

<p>After some fairly devastating news this morning &#8211; the death of Anthony Bourdain &#8211; I was relieved to find occasion to laugh out loud (literally) at some of the headlines I found, particularly those relating to Skinner&#8217;s work with pigeons. &#8220;&#8216;Educated&#8217; Pigeons Work at Harvard.&#8221; &#8220;Smart Pigeons Attend Harvard.&#8221; (The irony, of course: it isn&#8217;t smart pigeons. It&#8217;s pigeons who can take advantage of legacy admissions.)</p>

<p>From his papers, it appears as though the pigeon work &#8211; pigeons playing ping pong &#8211; was the first time Skinner really gained national notoriety. And certainly that colored how his other work has received by the public. (It&#8217;s why, for example, there were headlines about teaching children like pigeons.)</p>

<p>There seemed to be waves of public attention, often tied to big media profile pieces &#8211; articles in The Wall Street Journal and New York Times and Fortune in the like. (These coincide, I&#8217;m sure if I look closely, with the floods of letters he&#8217;d receive too.) And to his credit, his work all seems incredibly timely &#8211; not just the pigeons trained for war, but animals trained for space travel. (Today I learned, for example, that Ham was trained with a teaching machine.) Teaching machines and babies in a box &#8211; both of these tapping into post-War desires for automation and gadgetry. His novel <em>Walden Two</em>, which seemed to find renewed popularity in the 1960s with various intentional communities.</p>

<p>And maybe it&#8217;s one of those &#8220;chicken and the egg&#8221; problems: what came first? The idea or the Harvard imprimatur? </p>

<p>I leave the archives with tons of material, but no real sense quite yet what I want to make of it. I think I have a lot of reading to do by other educators (and philosophers of education) from the 1950s and 1960s to better make sense of Skinner&#8217;s work and to understand what schools were like at the time &#8211; or how at least they were imagined by these dudes. Mostly dudes. </p>

<p>(If you&#8217;re interested in what I&#8217;ve I&#8217;ve discovered during my week here, here are updates from Days <a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/06/04/harvard1">1</a>, <a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/06/05/harvard2">2</a>, <a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/06/06/harvard3">3</a>, and <a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/06/07/harvard4">4</a>.) </p>
